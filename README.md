# Simple Audio Recognition with TensorFlow and Keras

This repository contains code that demonstrates building a basic automatic speech recognition (ASR) model using TensorFlow and Keras. The model is trained to recognize keywords from audio clips.

## Project Overview

This project showcases the process of creating an ASR model for recognizing specific keywords in audio clips. The key steps include:

- Preprocessing: Audio files are converted into spectrogram images, suitable for the model's input.
- Model: A CNN is designed using Keras for keyword recognition.
- Training: The model is trained on the preprocessed audio data.
- Evaluation: Model performance is assessed using metrics like accuracy and loss.
- Inference: The model is used to predict keywords in new audio samples.

## Code Structure

The code is divided into two parts:

1. **Part 1**: Data preprocessing, model construction, training, and evaluation.
2. **Part 2**: Visualization of training progress, evaluation metrics, and inference on an audio file.

## Getting Started

To run the code:

1. Install Dependencies: TensorFlow, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn (for visualization).
2. Clone the Repository
3. Run the Code: Execute Part 1 for preprocessing, model building, and training. Continue with Part 2 for visualization, evaluation, and inference.
4. Customize: Adjust hyperparameters and architecture for experimentation.

## Results

The trained ASR model achieves a certain accuracy on the test dataset. Further improvements can be explored by tweaking architecture and training settings.
